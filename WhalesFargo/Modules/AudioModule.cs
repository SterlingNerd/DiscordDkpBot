     * AudioModule
     * This handles all the audio commands for the bot.
     * 
     * This supports playing local songs (from the machine the bot is running on) and most network
     * songs that youtube-dl supports.
     * 
     * It also maintains it's own playlist and can be mixed between local and network sources.
     * 
     * Since this is meant to run on a single server, it should only be joined in a single
     * voice channel at a time. We set it up to allow multiple channel connections, but we only
     * have a single instance of the audioplayer. If the bot exists in multiple servers, it will only
     * interact with the voice chat in the last server it received the commands in.
     * 
     * As a module, this will interact with AudioService, using commands from Discord.
