     * 
     * AudioDownloader handles reading simple meta data from network links and local songs. If specified,
     * it'll download network songs into a default folder.
     * 
     * AudioPlayer handles the local and network streams then passes it into FFmpeg to output to the voice channel.
     * 
     * Right now the playlist is maintained in the service, but may be abstracted or moved into another
     * class in the future.
